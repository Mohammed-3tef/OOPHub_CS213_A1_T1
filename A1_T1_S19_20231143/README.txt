This code has menu make the user choose which problem he wants or to exit the program
    1. Problem 2 (Convert Pronouns To Gender Inclusive) : This name reflects the purpose of the function,
                which is to convert male pronouns into gender-inclusive alternatives.
    2. Problem 5 (Manage Player Scores) : Interactive menu system for adding new players, displaying the top 10 players,
                searching for a player's highest score, and exiting the program.
    3. Problem 8 (Fractal Pattern) : Generates a recursive fractal star pattern by halving the size at each step,
                with increasing indentation. The size must be a power of 2, and the user controls the horizontal shift,
                creating a nested, symmetrical pattern.
    4. Problem 11 (File Comparison Program) : Enables users to compare two text files, identifying differences at
                both character and word levels, while providing an intuitive interface for
                selecting comparison methods and file paths.

These are the outputs of the problem 11 (File Comparison Program) with the files in the same directory:
    - file + file1 :
        -  (Character by character) => The Two Files Are Identical.
        -  (Word by word) => The Two Files Are Identical.

    - file + file2 :
        -  (Character by character) =>
            The Difference found at line 1:
                - File 1: 10. Message Altering to Avoid Censorship. In time of conflict, as currently, social media platforms
                - File 2: 10. Message Altering to Avoid Censorship.    In time of conflict, as currently, social media platforms
        -  (Word by word) => The Two Files Are Identical.

    - file + file3 :
        -  (Character by character) =>
            The Difference found at line 1:
                - File 1: 10. Message Altering to Avoid Censorship. In time of conflict, as currently, social media platforms
                - File 2: 10. Message Altering to Avoid Censorship.   In time of conflict, as currently, social media platforms
        -  (Word by word) =>
            The Difference found at line 2, word 18:
            The Difference Words are: (C++) & (Python)
                - File 1: usually have bias to one side and censor content or posts supporting the other side. Write a C++
                - File 2: usually have bias to one side and censor content or posts supporting the other side. Write a Python

    - file + file4 :
        -  (Character by character) => The Two Files Are Not The Same Size...
        -  (Word by word) => The Two Files Are Not The Same Size...
